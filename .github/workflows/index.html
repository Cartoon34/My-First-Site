    <h1>Welcome To First Site</h1>
    <p>Creating my first webpage marks the beginning of my journey into web development. A webpage is a basic building block of the internet, made using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to structure content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style it. This initial project introduces essential concepts such as adding text, images, and links, as well as customizing layout and appearance using CSS.

The main goal of this webpage is to understand how HTML elements work together and how styles can be applied to enhance the user experience. Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful step toward building interactive and visually appealing websites.
